= S&P500 December Seasonality

As we approach the last weeks of the year, something to keep in mind for December's seasonality. X axis is day of month, and Y axis is cumulative return of S&P500 over December for years 1953 to 2016.

Average returns are nice, but knowing how volatilite it is would also be good to know. Utilizing a pivot table to calculate, the annualized standard deviation for each day is plotted below:

t = pd.pivot_table( df_dec, values='SpyRet', columns='DOM', aggfunc=np.mean)
(t.cumsum()*100.0).plot( grid=True)

(t*np.sqrt(252)*100).plot( grid=True, title='December Return Annualized Volatility By Day')
