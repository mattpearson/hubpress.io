= Decoding CME's MDP 3.0

MDP stands for Market Data Protocol, and CME is on their third revision of it. In this latest revision, they decomissioned FAST encoding with SBE. 

Note, this requires that you have Java JDK installed, so if you don't, then run:

[source,bash]
su -c "yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk"

Next, use git to download and install Real Logic's simple binary encoding example implementation.
[source,bash]
-------------------
$ git clone https://github.com/real-logic/simple-binary-encoding.git
$ ./gradlew
