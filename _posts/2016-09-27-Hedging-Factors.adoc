= Hedging Factors

== Review

The CAPM suggests that a firm's expected excess return (Ri) above the risk-free rate (Rf) is simply a scaled version of the market portfolio (Rm) expected excess return. In other words:  ( Ri - Rf ) = scaling factor * ( Rm - Rf ). Put differently,

( Ri - Rf ) = alpha + beta * ( Rm - Rf ).

Gene Fama and Ken French argued convincingly that there are additional risk factors that can better describe the expected excess return, namely a size premium (SMB) and a value premium (HML). Recent research has shown that the expected return can further be improved with additional factors. Cliff Asness eloquently  https://www.aqr.com/cliffs-perspective/our-model-goes-to-six-and-saves-value-from-redundancy-along-the-way[describes them] as follows:

. Premium Factors
* RM-RF 	The return spread between the capitalization weighted stock market and cash.
* SMB	     The return spread of small minus large stocks (i.e., the size effect).
* HML	     The return spread of cheap minus expensive stocks (i.e., the value effect).
* RMW	    The return spread of the most profitable firms minus the least profitable.
* CMA	     The return spread of firms that invest conservatively minus aggressively.
